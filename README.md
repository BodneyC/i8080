# I8080

I got bored and decided to make a pretty bad Intel 8080 emulator.

Along the way I also got sick of writing little programs in hex... so I also wrote an assembler.

I also figured if I had an assembler, I should also have a disassemble.

## Install and Build

```sh
git clone https://github.com/BodneyC/8080-rs.git
cd 8080-rs
cargo install --path .
```

## Try it Out

There are some examples
